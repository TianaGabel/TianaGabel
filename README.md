- 👋 Hi, I’m @TianaGabel
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics and Computer vision.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking online university courses at snhu towards a computer science degree.
-    I've learnt the basics in python, java, C++ and some assembly for the 6502 mircoprocessor.
-    But I still need practice in using libraries and software.
- 💞️ I would be interested in collaborating.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
